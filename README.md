# Introduction

V Indefinite Modding Suite Evolved (VIMS Evo).

"V" from Grand Theft Auto V

  - Versions `0.X`, are usable but i can't guarantee they are 100% stable. Before `1.X` release every version means I don't fully understand GIMS Evo code.
  - You can help me with this by commenting your ideas on the code. Let's give it a challenge to everyone.

I won't promise any new feature! This is a fun project, I'm just trying to help those who are used to GIMS Evo or 3ds Max. There are already other tools that are much more moddern, efficient and at a great active development by the community, like [Sollumz](https://github.com/Skylumz/Sollumz) for Blender. I **do not want** anyone to see this as competition, as an example.. for my personal daily use I choose Sollumz and I don't compare both, these tools are made by the community for the community.

## Requirements

<br>

-	Recommended:
	- Windows 10 or Windows 11
	- .NET Framework 4.0
	- 3ds Max 2017 or latest ( with AvGuard DLX Extension )
- Minimum:
	- Windows 7
	- .NET Framework 4.0
	- 3ds Max ( with AvGuard DLX Extension )

*The minimum requirements aren't supported even if it works! Always use the latest version.*

## Installation

<br>

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/cosmitir/VIMS-Evo/releases/latest/).
2. Drag the `scripts` folder to your 3ds Max directory. ( Default: "C: \ Program Files \ Autodesk \ 3ds Max XXXX \", where XXXX stands for the version... i.e.: 2022 )
3. Drag the `GIMS` folder to Local AppData folder. ( Win + R > %localappdata% )
4. Get `materialfx.dat` and `materials.dat` with help of [CodeWalker](https://github.com/dexyfex/CodeWalker) or OpenIV.
   1. Paste those files in `%localappdata%\GIMS\MaterialData\`.
5. Startup 3ds Max. Enjoy.
